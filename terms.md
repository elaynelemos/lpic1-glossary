### 101 Exam

#### Topic 101: System Architecture

**BIOS:** Basic Input/Output System

**Bootloader:** Short for "bootstrap loader" also known as a boot program, it is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a bootloader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computerâ€™s firmware about where the bootloader is. _[(source)](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/)_

**Daemon:** Program that runs continuously and exists for the purpose of handling periodic service requests that a computer system expects to receive. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. _[(source)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/daemon)_

**DMA:** Direct Memory Access

**DOS:** Disk Operating System

**EFI:** Extensible Firmware Interface

**ESP:** EFI System Partition

**FAT:** File Allocation Table

**Firmware:** Program stored in a non-volatile memory chip attached to the motherboard, executed every time the computer is powered on. Unlike normal software, firmware cannot be changed or deleted by an end-user without using special programs, and remains on that device whether it's on or off. _[(1st source)](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/101-500/101/101.2/101.2_01/)_ _[(2nd source)](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/firmware.htm)_

**GRUB:** Grand Unified Bootloader

**IRQ:** Interrupt Request

**Kernel:** Software code that serves as a layer between the hardware and main programs that run on a computer. It is the first part to load when the OS boots up. It is loaded in memory and stays there throughout the entire time the computer is in session. _[(source)](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/what-is-linux-kernel)_

**MBR:** Master Boot Record

**NVRAM:** Non-Volatile Random Access Memory

**PCI:** Peripheral Component Interconnect

**POST:** Power-On Self-Test

**RAM:** Random Access Memory

**ROM:** Read-Only Memory

**SATA:** Serial Advanced Technology Attachment

**SCSI:** Small Computer System Interface

**UEFI:** Unified Extensible Firmware Interface

**USB:** Universal Serial Bus
